# FIT2004 Algorithms and Data Structures

## Special Thanks to Dr Ian Lim Wern Han

This Repository contains notes and also scaffolds of algorithms and data structures that were taught throughout the semester. 
Notes are made in the form of Jupyter Notebook, Describing in detail how each algorithm and data structure works, together with some complexity analysis.

There are parts of scaffolds of code that were introduced in this unit. The repository includes code scaffolds for: 
- Radix Sort
- Counting Sort
- Node, Edge and Graph Class
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Ford-Fulkerson method
- Trie Class

## Do note that the scaffold code can still be improved on, and it may not work as intended sometimes, check docstrings or refer to other sources to verify the correctness of the code.
