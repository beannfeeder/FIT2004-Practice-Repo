    "Complexity\n",
    "- A recap\n",
    "    - what is required to run the algorithm\n",
    "    - input is sufficiently large\n",
    "        - aka input cannot be empty or small\n",
    "- Time\n",
    "    - Best, scenario when it is the algorithm is the fastest\n",
    "        - binary search = O(1) when the item you are searching for is in the middle\n",
    "        - my list is large, n-items\n",
    "    - Worst, scenario when it is the algorithm is the slowest\n",
    "        - binary search = O(log n) when 1st item (leftmost), last item (rightmost), or not found\n",
    "    - Big-O, O(N) upper bound\n",
    "        - how it scaling or order of magnitude\n",
    "            - linear O(N)\n",
    "            - exponential O(2^N)\n",
    "        - ignore any constant\n",
    "            - O(N) + O(N log N)\n",
    "                - N + N log N = N (1 + log N) = N log N\n",
    "            - N * (N - 1) = O(N^2)\n",
    "        - only look at the biggest magnitude, order, exponent\n",
    "    - Big-Theta, Î˜(N) tightest bound\n",
    "        - view it as big-O but PRECISE aka tightest bound, due to the lower bound as well\n",
    "- Space = input + aux\n",
    "    - Input, cant control\n",
    "        - bubble sort accepts a list of N items\n",
    "            - input space complexity = O(N)\n",
    "            - pass by reference, still consider it as the same input space\n",
    "    - Auxiliary, extra space\n",
    "        - bubble sort accepts a list of N items\n",
    "            - O(1) aux space, because it only uses index (pointers), temp var for swapping\n",
    "            - O(1) STILL consume space. It means it uses CONSTANT space (aka doesn't scale with input).\n",
    "        - INPLACE = O(1) aux\n",
    "    - Recursion?\n",
    "        - will never be inplace aka wont have O(1) aux space\n",
    "        - anything recursion, have to + O(recursive depth)\n",
    "        - recursive stack = space used...\n",
    "    - Examples:\n",
    "        - Is bubble sort inplace? Yes, O(1) aux\n",
    "        - Is merge sort inplace? No, resurive stack = O(log N) depth, O(N) aux for temp list merging\n",
    "- Time vs Space\n",
    "    - time complexity >= aux space complexity\n",
    "        - time = O(N), aux space = O(N) is correct\n",
    "        - time = O(N^2), aux space = O(1) is correct\n",
    "        - time = O(N), aux space = O(N log N) is false\n",
    "        - reason: you needd time to create the extra space and fill it up\n",
    "- Output sensitive\n",
    "    - see lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try with binary search\n",
    "- Time = ???\n",
    "- Space = ???\n",
    "    - Input space = ???\n",

    "- What is recursion?\n",
    "    - function calling itself\n",
    "    - with smaller input\n",
    "        - until you reach base case\n",
    "- What is recurrence relation?\n",
    "    - a relation that describes the time complexity of a recursive algorithm\n",
    "    - 2 components\n",
    "        - base case, make sure to know how to find it...\n",
    "        - recursive case, make sure to know how to find it... and not be fooled. The tricks are here\n",
    "- How to solve recurrence relation?\n",
    "    1. Telescoping\n",
    "        - T(N/k) or T(N-k)\n",
    "        - watch the tutorial videos, they are all there\n",
    "    2. Master theorem\n",
    "        - T(N/k)\n",

    "- What is it?\n",
    "    - take a large problem\n",
    "    - split into smaller problem\n",
    "    - solve smallest\n",
    "    - combine it together at the end\n",
    "- How is it related to Karatsuba?\n",
    "    - How it work? A * B\n",
    "        1. split A and B into smaller halves\n",
    "        2. multiple the smaller halves with each other based on the formula. There is 3 multiplication (4 reduced to 3)?\n",
    "        3. Repeat again for each of the halves from step 2 until base case (smol smol numbers)\n",
    "    - complexity?\n",
    "        - let say A and B has N digits / bits\n",
    "        - time = O(N^log_2 3) = O(N^1.59)\n",
