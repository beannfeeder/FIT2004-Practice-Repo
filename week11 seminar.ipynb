    "\n",
    "What to watch?\n",
    "- All the Trie videos\n",
    "\n",
    "Trie (aka prefix trie)\n",
    "- What is it?\n",
    "    - binary search tree you have 2 children that is left and right\n",
    "    - a trie has k-children children -- where k is the charset / universe of chars\n",
    "        - a...z = 26\n",
    "        - a...z and A...Z = 52\n",
    "        - of course, if you wish, include the terminal ($)\n",
    "            - +1 for terminal\n",
    "            - preferably at the front (index-0) to maintain lexicographical order\n",
    "                - \"aaa$\" vs \"aa$\"\n",
    "    - traverse based on key, down an edge\n",
    "        - do you need to implement the Edge class??? No\n",
    "            - the information can be stored at the vertex pointed by the children link\n",
    "            - you can access the child node you want, using the ascii value with some simple math\n",
    "- Node\n",
    "    - what is the key??? alphabet / char\n",
    "        - the pointer, aka the edges that lead to them from the root\n",
    "        - do you need to store the key??? No\n",
    "    - what is the payload / data???\n",
    "        - can save anything you need\n",
    "            - example1 = freq\n",
    "            - example2 = top-k similar words\n",
    "            - example3 = ???\n",
    "            - example4 = ???\n",
    "        - but be careful, do not abuse it, only save is needed\n",
    "            - constant so O(1) / doesn't scale with what you don't need\n",
    "    - what are the children???\n",
    "        - O(k) where k is the charset\n",
    "        - charset is always constant, ie O(k) is O(1)\n",
    "    - space of a Node = O(children) + O(payload) = ???\n",
    "- Insert\n",
    "    - Terminal needed??? Yes\n",
    "    - iterative vs recursive\n",
    "        - iterative is ???\n",
    "        - recursive is ???\n",
    "            - recursive have the benefit to carry information back up\n",
    "                - to make decision\n",
    "                - in general, I recommend recursive\n",
    "            - can iteration achieve the same????\n",
    "            - recursive uses the recursive stack -> aux spac complexity\n",
    "    - Time complexity: O(M)\n",
    "        - a word with M length\n",
    "        - If I insert N words, and the longest word is M characters long\n",
    "            - O(NM) to insert them all\n",
    "        - If I insert N words, they all add up to have T characters in total\n",
    "            - O(T) to insert them all\n",
    "- Delete???\n",
    "- Search\n",
    "    - same as insert???\n",
    "    - differences\n",
    "        - when insert, if children do not exist, create node\n",
    "        - when search, if children do not exist, return false, raise KeyError or whatever it is\n",
    "- Traversal\n",
    "    - is only 1 way in terms of order of nodes visit\n",
    "        - inorder vs preorder vs postorder\n",
    "            - are they the same???\n",
    "            - what do we care about here???\n",
    "                - left to right children -> lexicographical order\n",
    "    - time = O(M*N) or O(K)\n",
    "        - N words\n",
    "        - M characters for longest word\n",
    "        - K is the total number of nodes\n",
    "- complexity\n",
    "    - space complexity of a trie:\n",
    "        - N words\n",
    "            - O(N) leaves\n",
    "        - M is the longest word\n",
    "            - O(M+1) height\n",
    "        - How many nodes? O(M*N) nodes or O(T) where T is the total characters or O(K) where K is the total number of nodes\n",
    "            - but each node O(1) assuming payload is O(1)\n",
    "                - therefore total space of a trie is O(X?) sum up the payload at each node at each level... you cannot simply multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "Suffix Trie\n",
    "- How is it different from a Trie (prefix trie)\n",
    "    - all the same\n",
    "    - except of N words, you have M suffixes\n",
    "        - M is the length of the word\n",
    "        - M is the number of suffixes\n",
    "        - M is also the length of the longest suffix\n",
    "- Space if i have a word of size M\n",
    "    - i want a suffix trie\n",
    "    - i have M suffixes\n",
    "    - longest suffix is M characters long\n",
    "    - total is O(M+M-1+M-2+M-3) space.... O(M^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suffix Tree\n",
    "- Why is it needed?\n",
    "    - reduce number of nodes\n",
    "        - have better space complexity\n",
    "        - how??? compress the paths that doesn't branch\n",
    "        - further ensure edge/ link is O(1) using [start,end] index\n",
    "            - Note only for suffix tree\n",
    "            - Without this, it wont be efficient\n",
    "- What is the complexity\n",
    "    - a word of M characters word[1...M]\n",
    "    - O(M) space\n",
    "    - can you explain?\n",
    "        - O(M) number of nodes\n",
    "        - edges are O(1) due to [start,end]\n",
    "    - best case occur when??? all char are the same\n",
    "    - worst case occure when??? all differnet char\n",

    "Application of Trie\n",
    "- Normal Trie aka prefix trie\n",
    "    - a lot in tutorial\n",
    "    - in assignment as well\n",
