    "- find the shortest path\n",
    "(there will not be a better edge, only equivalent)\n",
    "    - shortest path from SOURCE\n",
    "        - to ALL vertices\n",
    "        - to target\n",
    "            - terminate earlier\n",
    "    - can it work for multiple sources???\n",
    "        - No, single source\n",
    "        - but you can flip if single destination\n",
    "            - what do ian mean???\n",
    "    - can it work for multiple destination???\n",
    "        - yes\n",
    "        - you need to create ???\n",
    "- greedy\n",
    "    - u = heap.serve()\n",
    "        - when u is served, u.distance is already the ??? from source\n",
    "    - when u loop through u.edges\n",
    "        - you calculate the distance from source to u + edge.w to v\n",
    "        - because of the above, we will calculate the shortest distance from source to v going throguh u\n",
    "    - that's why it will fail for certain negative edges\n",
    "        - more on that later\n",
    "- somewhat dynamic programming???\n",
    "    - can you explain this?\n",
    "    - use memory to save computation\n",
    "- vs BFS?\n",
    "    - Shortest distance from the source, same as Dijkstra\n",
    "        - BFS is the shortest distance by number of edges\n",
    "            - weight of all edge is 1\n",
    "            - u can use a normal queue\n",
    "        - Dijkstra is the shortest distance by weight sum of edges\n",
    "            - u need to use a priority queue where closer from source have higher priority (minheap)\n",
    "- 2 approach\n",
    "    - Large heap (approach 2)\n",
    "        - you can use built-in heapq\n",
    "        - because your heap have duplicates\n",
    "            - why do you have duplicates???\n",
    "        1. Size? maximum is O(V^2)\n",
    "        2. rise() or sink() complexity is O(log V^2)-> O(log V)\n",
    "        3. Number of append()/ serve() is E-times\n",
    "        total - O(E log V)\n",
    "    - Fixed heap (approach 1 in video)\n",
    "        - need to implement own heap\n",
    "            - take FIT1008 maxheap, and modify it to minheap\n",
    "            - add an update() function, but you need an index-array / mappinng array in O(log V)\n",
    "                - if you go to FIT3155 and learn Fib heap, you can update() in O(1)\n",
    "            - tldr go watch my tutorial\n",

    "- Work for negative edges?\n",
    "    - yes, but not 100%\n",
    "    - because of this, we don't use dijsktra if there are negative edges\n",
    "    - can you work out example on your own?\n",
    "- Complexity (for Dijkstra, not the entire graph)\n",
    "    - time = O(E log V)\n",
