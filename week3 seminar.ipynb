    "Proof of correctness with loop invariants\n",
    "- What is invariant?\n",
    "    - something that never CHANGES\n",
    "- What is loop invariant?\n",
    "    - it always TRUE in every iteration\n",
    "    - it or combinantion of loop invariants contributes to the correctness/ ensures the output is correct\n",
    "- How to prove correctness of an algorithm using loop invariants?\n",

    "Recap of sorting\n",
    "- Time complexity\n",
    "    - number of comparisons\n",
    "    - number of swaps\n",
    "    - number of comparisons >= number of swaps\n",
    "- Space complexity\n",
    "    - assume u sort list[1...N]\n",
    "        - why 1...N and not 0...N-1?\n",
    "        - \n",
    "    - input space: O(N)\n",
    "    - aux space:\n",
    "        - O(1) aka constant space aka inplace. What are the sorting algorithms?\n",
    "        - O(log N) = Binary Sort\n",
    "        - O(N) = Selection, Insertion\n",
    "- Stability\n",
    "    - maintain relative order / relative order doesnt change\n",
    "    - shifting is usually stable. Why???\n",
    "        - example = mergesort (left before right sublist)\n",
    "    - swapping (not next to each other) is usually unstable unless the swap maintain order (aka mergesort, left before right sublist). Why???\n",
    "        - example = quicksort\n",
    "- The items matter for comparison-based sorts (bubble, selection, insertion, heap, merge, quick)\n",
    "    - String with M chars, O(M)\n",
    "        example: bubble sort will be O(N^2)\n",
    "    - Integer with B-base, O(1)\n",
    "        - why? hardware MAGIC\n",
    "- Let's use a pass year example...\n",
    "    - LO3 compare and contrast questions are popular!\n",
    "    - Let us build a table, comparing all sorts\n",
    "        - Best case\n",
    "        - Worst case\n",
    "        - What happen when best case == worst case?\n",
    "        - Aux space\n",
    "- Application of sorting? watch the tutorial\n",
    "    - it groups similar items together\n",
    "    - what else???\n",

    "Counting Sort\n",
    "- Not comparison-based\n",
    "    - no comparison, no swapping\n",
    "    - therefore no comparison cost!!!\n",
    "- Concept\n",
    "    - count the freq, rebuild back based on frequency\n",
    "- Concept with the bucket variant (recommended or what you should be doing)\n",
    "    - append into bucket (aka a bucket for small, medium, big fish)\n",
    "    - can implement a normal queue (linked) or just assume Python's [] list is ok\n",
    "- Time complexity, for N items, with M largest item (integer)\n",
    "    1. find max O(N)\n",
    "    2. initialize count_array O(r)\n",
    "    3. loop through list, update count_array O(n)\n",
    "    4. loop through count_array, rebuild original list O(r+n)\n",
    "    - Total = ???\n",
    "- consider the following\n",
    "    - I have N items, let say = 100\n",
    "    - Biggest item is 1,000,000\n",
    "    - N = 100, M = 1,000,000, M = N^3\n",
    "    - what is the complexity??? O(???)\n",
    "    - should you use counting sort for this scenario???\n",
    "- Space complexity\n",
    "    - input list = O(???)\n",
    "    - count_array = O(???)\n",
    "    - count_array if unstable = O(???), aux_space = O(???)\n",
    "    - count array if stable = O(???), aux_space = O(???)\n",
    "    - total space = input + aux = O(???)\n",
    "- What happen if your list smallest item is negative?\n",
    "    - list, min=-322, max=420\n",
    "    - what can you do???\n",
    "    - M can be the range, not the max!!!\n",

    "-----\n",

    "Radix sort\n",
    "- Not comparison-based\n",
    "- Concept\n",
    "    - counting sort but with columns\n",
    "        - number of columns k = log_base (max_item) + 1 = ???\n",
    "        - choosing a suitable base (up to N) will ensure linear complexity\n",
    "            - base shouldnt be >= N or anything, cause it affect count_array thus wont be ???\n",
    "            - can you try with different value of M?\n",
    "            - in order words, we abuse the log function to split M into multiple chunks of N. This result in us having k columns.\n",
    "            - recall counting sort is O(N + b), radix sort is O(kN + kb) where b is the base. Thus you can see how we manipulat M -> kb\n",
    "        - if M is a function of N, that is less than N^N or N!, choosing a base of N will ensure linear complexity\n",
    "            - let's try this...\n",
    "        - common mistake from what i see in the code review of earlier semesters\n",
    "            - counting sort we have to find the max() for count-array.\n",
    "                - Do we need it for radix sort? ???\n",
    "            - how do you calculate the number of columns?\n",
    "                - What is the formula???\n",
    "            - what about the formula to determine value for each column?\n",
    "                - What is the formula???\n",
    "    - count_array or bucket_array\n",
    "        - depends on ur base\n",
    "    - number of columns\n",
    "        - relationship vs base?\n",
    "        - see equation above\n",
    "- Complexity?\n",
    "    - N = number of items\n",
    "    - M = largest item\n",
    "    - k = number of columns\n",
    "    - b = base\n",
    "    - Time complexity? O(???)\n",
    "    - Aux Space? O(???)\n",
    "- Optimization for string?\n",
    "    - Using length, if the length differs\n",
    "    - Depends if left-align or right-align for string\n",
    "    - Also see if u loop bottom-up or top-down, do explore this and i wont give you the answer.\n",
    "    - There is an extra video I recorded about this.\n",
    "- When to use radix sort vs other sort?\n",
    "    - Give me a list...\n",
    "    - we do this next week when we compare sorts... but till then, use the table!!!\n",
    "- Now let us extend the table we drew earlier..."
