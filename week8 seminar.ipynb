    "Watch the videos as posted on Moodle, especially for the Sanity Check. There are 2 videos, one is on Bellman-Ford + Floyd-Warshall, then there is the 2nd one which is on the optimization itself. I won't provide the link here as some say it is confusing so let's just go over to Moodle.\n",

    "Bellman-Ford (BF)\n",
    "- Single source Shortest Distance\n",
    "    - multiple destination??? Yes\n",
    "    - multiple source single destination? Yes, reverse graph\n",
    "- Concept\n",
    "    - Dynamic Programming\n",
    "        - Overlapping subproblems: number edges -> shortest from source to a vertex using i edges, we reuse i-1 shortest distance + a new edge\n",
    "        - Optimal subsolution: shortest distance using i-1 edges\n",
    "        - this is done by looping through the edges, lookinng at the previous column\n",
    "    - How to backtrack???\n",
    "        - cell store (distance, prev)\n",
    "    - How to know if there is a negative cycle???\n",
    "        - given a graph with |V| vertices\n",
    "            - maximum number of edge for a path without cycle = v-1 edges\n",
    "        - shortest distance using up to v edges is less than shortest distance using v-1 edges -> have negative cycle\n",
    "- Early termination\n",
    "    - Possible??? Yes\n",
    "        - if i-1 iteration and i iteration have the ??? value\n",
    "            - you realize that when it converges (ie all shortest distance found), the numbers will not change\n",
    "- optimization\n",
    "    - Lecture = do you need a matrix of V * (V+1)???\n",
    "    - Applied = do you need 2 column???\n",
    "        - the number of edges doesn't matter anymore\n",
    "        - the order of edges do matter... you want to reach the point where i and i+1 deoesn't change\n",
    "            - different value depends on order of edges\n",
    "            - but at the end, it will be the same\n",
