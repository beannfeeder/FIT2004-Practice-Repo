    "## Week 07\n",
    "\n",
    "Lecture to watch?\n",
    "- Please watch the dynamic programming lecture as shown on Moodle and please trace through all of them by hand. The past quizzes have shown you all \n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorial to watch?\n",
    "- All 5 videos are covering a lot of important content. Watch them as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming\n",
    "- Brute force\n",
    "    - in smarter way?\n",
    "        - why? you break a problem down in a way that is repetitive (patterns!)\n",
    "        - is it faster??? yes\n",
    "        - what is the trade off??? memorize solution, do not recompute (thus faster), need memory\n",
    "- What is it?\n",
    "    - Overlapping subproblems\n",
    "        - reuse partial solution\n",
    "    - Optimal solution (or rather the subsolution)\n",
    "        - to avoid recomputing because answer is wrong / not optimal\n",
    "        - remember, the solution are reused, so it needs to be optimal or else everything is not optimal\n",
    "    - vs Divide and Conquer?\n",
    "        - DnC doesnt overlap or it is not solution is recomputed\n",
    "        - mergesort\n",
    "- Time vs Space\n",
    "    - use space to reduce time (aka no recomputation)\n",
    "- Recurrence relation?\n",
    "    - Previous\n",
    "        - used to find the time complexity of recursive functions...\n",
    "    - but dynamic programming is difference\n",
    "        - show how to find the optimal solution\n",
    "            - at each memo\n",
    "            - at each step\n",
    "            - ... these represent the subproblems\n",
    "                - and finally the overall problem\n",
    "    - if you know the recurrence relation, programming is just based on the recurrence relation\n",
    "    - 3 cases\n",
    "        - base\n",
    "            - initial value u initialize\n",
    "            - requirement?\n",
    "                - base case only have ONE answer / option no matter what\n",
    "                - that ONE answer / option is always optimal, NO DECISION\n",
    "            - IMPORTANT TO HAVE\n",
    "                - why? this is where backtracking end\n",
    "        - general case\n",
    "            - depends on an earlier smaller case aka your subproblem(s)\n",
    "                - subproblem(s) already have an optimal solution(s)\n",
    "                - AND you need to make decisions which to use / take.\n",
    "        - edge cases\n",
    "            - like your general case\n",
    "            - could reuse earlier subproblem\n",
    "            - often no more decision needed\n",
    "            - think of the maze question(s) from the tutorial when you are at the edge of the maze...\n",
    "- aux space\n",
    "    - memoization\n",
    "        - 1D array = O(N)\n",
    "        - 2D array = O(N*M)\n",
    "        - 3D array = O(A*B*C)\n",
    "    - this sets the lower bound for time complexity\n",
    "        - need time to create the memo\n",
    "        - <almost> every position / cell need to be filled\n",
    "            - this isn't just O(1), it can be >O(1) like coin change, we go through each coin at each value\n",
    "- time complexity\n",
    "- 2 ways implement\n",
    "    - top-down\n",
    "        - go from large to small\n",
    "        - need recursion\n",
    "    - bottom-up\n",
    "        - start from base case to large\n",
    "        - do not need recursion\n",
    "    - both have the same recurrence relation\n",
    "    - which is more efficient? depends on the problem\n",
    "        - if you can skip some subproblems, top-down\n",
    "        - if you need all subproblems, bottom-up\n",
    "- Finding optimal?\n",
    "    - look at the recurrence relation\n",
    "    - watch my videos for the process... EZ\n",
    "- Backtracking optimal?\n",
    "    - do not store complete solution at each memo\n",
    "        - because it is a waste of space\n",
    "    - only save the breadcrumbs\n",
    "        - dijkstra, this is your prev\n",
    "        - knapsack, this is your last item added\n",
    "        - coin change, this is the last coin added\n",
    "        - ... and so on and so on...\n",
    "    - is it possible to not use memo for breadcrumbs?\n",
    "        - YES, because there are concepts such as inclusion-exclusion principle\n",
    "            - we saw this in lecture + tutorial\n",
    "            - but not always\n",
    "    - dont worry, even if u use memo for breadcrumbs, if within complexity you are GUCCI!\n",
