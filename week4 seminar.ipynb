    "- What is the invariants (at the end of the loop)? Assume increasing order...\n",
    "    - left partition is <= pivot\n",
    "    - right partition is > pivot\n",
    "    - pivot is at the correct / final / sorted position \n",
    "- Partition with pivot\n",
    "    - Why it matters? bcoz of the invariants above\n",
    "    - Type of partitions?\n",
    "        - Out of place\n",
    "            - partition in a temporary list\n",

    "            - less swapping\n",
    "            - L and R, similar to what i shown with out of place but you do it inplace\n",
    "            - Note: there is a possible bug / special case for this to fail at the final swap as what I mentioned in lecture...\n",
    "            (left and right pointer overlap, pivot is at right postition)\n",
    "    - Complexity for partition?\n",
    "        - Time: O(N) because you need to go through all items, to compare vs pivot\n",

    "        - best case is O(log N) when pivot is always middle\n",
    "        - worst case is O(N) is when pivot is always left or right\n",
    "        - average case is O(log N) when pivot is randomly selected on average\n",

    "Improving QuickSort with Dutch National Flag (DNF)\n",
    "- What is DNF?\n",
    "    - 3 partitions\n",
    "        - < pivot\n",
    "        - = pivot\n",
    "        - > pivot\n",
    "- Why it matters?\n",
    "    - allows you to skip processing (in future recursive steps) for items that are the ??? as pivot is at the correct position (aka the middle partition)\n",
    "- When to use DNP?\n",
    "    - list[1...N] in the format of....\n",
    "        - best case: all items are ???\n",
    "        - worst case: all items are ???\n",
    "- if best case for DNF occur, complexity of quick sort becomes O(???)\n",
    "    - partition O(N)\n",
    "    - recursion depth O(1) because left is empty, right is empty, no recursion\n",

    "QuickSelect(mylist, k)\n",
    "k is where u want the pivot to be\n",
    "- What is it?\n",
    "    - partition the list into 2 parts\n",
    "    - based to pivot, pivot is given by the user as the input (aka the position i want)\n",
    "        - we call this the k-order or k-value that is argument to the algorithm\n",
    "        - return the item in that position (in order)\n",
    "            - order can be increasing or decreaasing... read the Q carefully\n",
    "            - if k=10, partition list of 50 items in increasing\n",
    "                -10th smallest on the left, 40th biggest on the right\n",
    "            \n",
    "- How does it link to QuickSort?\n",
    "    - quicksort does sorts, quickselect does only partition based on the wanted pivot position and the partitions are not in order\n",
    "    - Partiotioning: both uses partitioning. O(N) to partition\n",
    "    - Recursion: quicksort go both side (recursively), quickselect go one side (recursively)\n",
    "- How does it link to binary search?\n",
    "    - binary search = search for the element, if it exist\n",
    "    - quickselect = search for the element based on the position (k-value)\n",
    "    - both only recurse 1 side\n",
    "- What is the application?\n",
    "    - IMPORTANT when you don't want to sort...\n",
    "        - partitions are not sorted, they only maintain invariant L <= pivot < R or vice versa\n",
    "    - k-order statistic\n",
    "    - there is a practice quiz I made last sem, but not sure if I can share it...\n",
    "- Time complexity? quickselect(list, k)\n",
    "    - Best: \n",
    "        - O(N) when pivot is at k after the 1st partition, because still need to perform partition\n",
    "        - no recrusion needed, ??? depth\n",
    "    - Worst: O(M^2) because each time, the pivot is not what you want, and either L or R is empty\n",
    "        - recursion of N depth\n",
    "    - Average: O(N)\n",
    "        - same logic as quicksort, except only go one side... watch my video!\n",

    "        - Look at the name... No\n",
    "    - Doing so for quickselect, ensure quickselect worst case will never be O(???)\n",
    "- How does it work?\n",
    "    - I have a video for it...\n",
    "    - You have columns...\n",
    "        - What is the column size in the video??? 5\n",
    "        - Can the size change??? \n",
    "        - Can the size be even???\n",
    "        - if size is bigger, perform better or worse?\n",
    "            - faster or slower???\n",
    "            - is it more accurate (closer to median)??? no\n",
    "        - if size is 1, perform better or worse? in what way? why?\n",
    "            - it is just the median, and no longer median of median\n",
    "            - it is the same as doing quickselect for the median\n",
    "- Time complexity? O(N log N), assuming size of column is 5\n",
    "    - u need to go through the list, one chunk at a time... O(N) items\n",
    "    - for each chunk, you do insertion sort, O(5^2) worst case... O(1)\n",
    "    - you have N/5 chunks, so O(N/5 * 25) = O(5N) = O(N)\n",
    "    - Recursion... with N/5 items... repeat... O(log N)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aux Space complexity? O(m), where m is the number of time quickselect recurse\n",
    "    - imaginary columns... they remain in the list\n",
    "        - everyone in class agree insertion sort is da best!!!!\n",
    "    - However, it calls quickselect that implements it recursively to find the medians in the list of median. Thus it is not in-place.\n",
